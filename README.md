## Introduction
This repository refers to the creation and implementation of the Fiber Optic Interface for Three phase Voltage Inverter Control System for PMSM motors. Every schematics, auxiliary files and performed steps are described in [engineering thesis](/thesis/Projekt%20i%20wykonanie%20interfejsu%20światłowodowego%20dla%20układu%20sterowania%20trójfazowego%20falownika%20napięcia%20dedykowanego%20dla%20silników%20PMSM.pdf). Main task was executed in Altium Designer Professional software ([engineering project](/main/Fibre-Optic-Interface.PrjPcb)). Additional documentations of used components and mechanical diagrams are stored in [doc](/doc/) folder.

## Abstract of Thesis
The diploma project entitled as “Design and Implementation of Fiber Optic Interface for Three
phase Voltage Inverter Control System for PMSM Motors” describes steps related to the construction 
of a communication interface, which enables connection of three-phase voltage inverter module 
EPC9167 dedicated to drive systems with permanent magnet synchronous motors, made in “TTL” 
standard with a rapid prototyping controller B-BOX made in fiber-optic transmission standard.  
Engineering thesis includes a test bench description of the PMSM motor test system comprising 
of the above-mentioned components with their specifications, presents design requirements and 
created technical documentation of the interface and documents the assembly and testing processes.  
The project was finished with conclusions of communication interfaces designing process, an 
opinion on the encountered problems and opportunities for development.
